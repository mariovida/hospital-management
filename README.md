## Overview

The Hospital Management System is a web application designed to streamline and enhance the management of hospital operations. This system provides an efficient solution for managing patient records, appointments, staff information, and more.

## Features

- **Patient Management:** Easily manage patient records, including personal information, medical history, and treatment details.

- **Appointment Scheduling:** Efficiently schedule and manage appointments for patients and medical staff.

- **Staff Information:** Keep track of staff details, including doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel.

- **Billing and Invoicing:** Streamline the billing process with features for generating invoices and tracking payments.

- **Reporting:** Generate reports to gain insights into various aspects of hospital management.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

- **Backend:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

- **Database:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed and running
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory

### Installation

1. Set up the backend:

- Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
